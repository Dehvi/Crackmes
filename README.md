# Crackmes

A new crackme every week and uploading the source code here.

## Purpose of this
- To learn C programming and and reverse engineering.
- Learning to implement the following methods into future crackmes
  -   Encryptions
  -   obfuscations
  -   anti-reverse engineering methods


## Reverse engineering 
I will document the reverse engineering of crackmes I create and how it could be made more difficult to crack.

I am using a win10 64bit system for reversing the crackmes.

## Installation / compiling
>gcc <fileName.c>
