# Crackmes

A new crackme every week and uploading the source code here.

## Purpose of this
- To learn C programming and and reverse engineering.
- Learning to implement the following methods into future crackmes
  -   Encryptions
  -   obfuscations
  -   anti-reverse engineering methods


## Reverse engineering part
After creating the crackme I will reverse it and create a writeup of it.

## Installation / compiling
> make or gcc <fileName.c>
